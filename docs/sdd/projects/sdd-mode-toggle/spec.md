## üéØ Project Overview

### Background
Users expect mode toggle commands for SDD (Spec-Driven Development) similar to LLM mode toggles (e.g., `grok-mode-on`, `gpt-mode-on`). Currently, SDD is accessed via deprecated `sdd-cli` or MCP flags, but dedicated on/off commands would improve usability and consistency.

### Objectives
- Add `sdd-mode-on` and `sdd-mode-off` commands to the CLI.
- Ensure SDD mode is toggled via flag files (e.g., `.cursor/.sdd-mode`).
- Maintain consistency with existing mode toggle patterns.

### Success Criteria
- Commands execute without errors and toggle SDD mode state.
- Mode state is persistent and affects SDD-related behaviors.
- No conflicts with existing LLM modes or other toggles.

## üìã Requirements

### Functional Requirements
[FR-001] Implement `sdd-mode-on` command that creates `.cursor/.sdd-mode` flag.
**Priority**: High
**Acceptance Criteria**: Command runs, creates flag file, provides user feedback.

[FR-002] Implement `sdd-mode-off` command that removes `.cursor/.sdd-mode` flag.
**Priority**: High
**Acceptance Criteria**: Command runs, removes flag file, provides user feedback.

### Non-Functional Requirements
[NFR-001] Follow existing mode toggle patterns (e.g., mutual exclusivity if needed).
**Metric**: Code structure matches `grok-mode-on/off` commands.

[NFR-002] Integrate with existing CLI help and command discovery.
**Metric**: Commands appear in CLI help and are discoverable.

### Business Rules
[BR-001] SDD mode should not conflict with LLM modes.
[BR-002] Flag files should be in `.cursor/` directory for consistency.

## üë• Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Product Owner**: CLI feature owner
- **End Users**: Developers using Super Prompt CLI

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Operations Team**: Maintains CLI consistency

## üîç Scope

### In Scope
- Add two new CLI commands: `sdd-mode-on` and `sdd-mode-off`.
- Create/remove flag files in `.cursor/.sdd-mode`.
- Update CLI help and documentation.

### Out of Scope
- Changes to SDD workflow logic itself.
- Integration with MCP tools beyond CLI commands.

### Assumptions
- Existing mode toggle code can be reused as a template.
- No performance impact on CLI startup.

### Constraints
- Must follow repository coding standards.
- Changes must be backward compatible.

---

## üîó Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing mode toggle commands (`grok-mode-on`, etc.) for code reuse.
- CLI framework (Typer) for command registration.

---

## üìä Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **R1**: Commands don't integrate properly with CLI help.
  - *Mitigation*: Test command discovery and help output.

### Medium Risk Items
- **R2**: Flag file conflicts with other modes.
  - *Mitigation*: Ensure unique flag names.

---

## üìö References
- Existing mode toggle commands in `cli.py`.
- CLI help and command structure.
