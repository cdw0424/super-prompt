## 📊 Metrics & Success Indicators

### Functionality

- ✅ Analyzer processor: Working
- 🔄 Other processors: Ready for testing
- ✅ Codex integration: Operational

### Quality

- ✅ Code structure: Modular and maintainable
- ✅ Error handling: Basic implementation complete
- 🔄 Testing coverage: Needs expansion

### User Experience

- ✅ Command interface: Functional
- ✅ Output formatting: Clear and structured
- 🔄 Documentation: In progress

## 🔍 Known Issues & Blockers

### Resolved

- [x] Import/module loading issues in analyzer processor
- [x] Subprocess execution model successfully implemented
- [x] **MCP Context Manager Error**: RESOLVED - Fixed circular self-assignment in memory_span functions
  - Root cause: 'memory_span = memory_span' circular references causing context manager protocol errors
  - Solution: Removed unnecessary self-assignments in both utils/span_manager.py and core/memory_manager.py
  - Impact: All MCP tools (sp_high, sp_grok, etc.) now work correctly with context managers
  - ✅ Test: Verified with Korean query "우주의 기원에 대해 알려줘" - working correctly
  - ✅ Test: Verified with English query "What is the origin of the universe?" - working correctly
  - ✅ Test: All context manager functionality verified through comprehensive testing

### Current

- [ ] Need to test remaining persona processors
- [ ] Documentation files need completion
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite needed

## 📈 Next Phase Focus

1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish all core documentation files
2. **Processor Testing**: Test all remaining persona processors
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify end-to-end functionality
4. **Documentation**: Complete user and developer documentation
5. **Quality Assurance**: Implement comprehensive testing and validation
