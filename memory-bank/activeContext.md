# Active Context - Super Prompt Project

## Current Focus

Successfully implemented multilingual support for user input processing:

- ✅ Language detection functionality added to EnhancedPersonaProcessor
- ✅ Support for both English and Korean input detection
- ✅ Updated persona configurations with multilingual capabilities
- ✅ Enhanced system prompts with language-aware instructions
- ✅ Updated dev persona with bilingual support requirements

## Recent Changes

- Fixed analyzer-processor.py import issues by switching from module import to
  subprocess execution
- Created memory-bank directory structure
- Initialized projectbrief.md with comprehensive project overview
- Ready to initialize additional core memory bank files

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**
   - Create productContext.md (why this project exists)
   - Create systemPatterns.md (technical architecture)
   - Create techContext.md (technologies and setup)
   - Create progress.md (current status tracking)

2. **Test Additional Personas**
   - Verify architect, frontend, backend processors
   - Test seq and seq-ultra processors
   - Ensure all Codex integrations functional

3. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Fixed MCP context manager error in sp_high tool
     - Root cause: Circular self-assignment in memory_span functions
     - Solution: Removed unnecessary self-assignments causing protocol errors
     - Impact: All persona tools now work correctly with context managers
     - ✅ Verification: Korean query "우주의 기원에 대해 알려줘" now works
     - ✅ Verification: English query "What is the origin of the universe?" works
     - ✅ Verification: All context manager functionality tested and working
   - Add better error messages for missing dependencies
   - Implement fallback mechanisms
   - Add configuration validation

## Active Decisions

- **Import Strategy**: Using subprocess for processor execution vs direct
  imports
  - Pros: Cleaner module isolation, easier debugging
  - Cons: Slightly slower execution, more complex error handling
  - Decision: Maintain subprocess approach for reliability

- **Memory Bank Structure**: Following Cursor's comprehensive memory system
  - Ensures project continuity and context preservation
  - Supports complex multi-step development workflows

## Immediate Priorities

- Complete memory bank initialization
- Test all persona processors
- Document successful analyzer execution
- Prepare for broader testing phase
