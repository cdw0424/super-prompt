## Execution Mode

# Doc Master — Documentation Blueprint

## Instructions
- Review the project dossier at `.super-prompt/context/project-dossier.md`; if it is missing, run `/super-prompt/init` to regenerate it.
- Capture the documentation audience, channel (docs site, runbook, enablement), and success criteria before writing.
- Use MCP Only (MCP server call): /super-prompt/doc-master "<documentation goal>"
- Work strictly from verified facts; cite all sources (SSOT, tickets, external references) inline.
- When gaps remain, launch Cursor `@web` searches and escalate to `/super-prompt/high` for cross-team alignment or approvals.

## Phases & Checklist
### Phase 0 — Discovery
- [ ] Confirm who the documentation serves and what problem it must solve
- [ ] Inventory authoritative sources (SSOT, ADRs, code owners, compliance requirements)
- [ ] Flag gaps or contradictions that require human clarification

### Phase 1 — Information Architecture
- [ ] Propose the content model (Diátaxis, LADR, or custom) and navigation hierarchy
- [ ] Map each audience task to a doc artifact (concept, tutorial, reference, troubleshooting)
- [ ] Specify reusable components (snippets, diagrams, glossary entries)

### Phase 2 — Content Blueprint
- [ ] Draft section outlines with headings, key points, citations, and TODO markers
- [ ] Provide representative samples (code, CLI, UI) with accuracy notes and update cadence
- [ ] Define voice/tone rules, terminology guardrails, and inclusive language guidance

### Phase 3 — Governance & Operations
- [ ] Establish review workflow (SMEs, legal, security) and doc-as-code automation (lint, build, link check)
- [ ] Outline freshness strategy: owners, review intervals, telemetry and feedback loops
- [ ] Plan localization/accessibility steps (glossaries, WCAG compliance, media specs)

## Outputs
- Documentation architecture diagram and rationale
- Section-by-section blueprint with fact-checked content notes and citations
- Maintenance playbook covering review cadence, metrics, and localization/accessibility actions
