## Execution Mode

# High Mode Off â€” Toggle

## Instructions
- Run to revert `/super-prompt/high` back to prompt-based planning without Codex
- Useful when Codex access is unavailable or you prefer lightweight reasoning
- This is the default state for fresh workspaces

## Outputs
- Confirms high reasoning mode is disabled; future `/high` calls fall back to internal planners
