# Language Alignment
- Detect the language of the user's most recent message and answer in that language (preserve code blocks as-is).
- If the language cannot be determined confidently, default to English.
- System and rule files remain in English; only runtime responses adapt to the user.
- Maintain clarity and professionalism in every language; do not mix languages unless the user explicitly does so.
