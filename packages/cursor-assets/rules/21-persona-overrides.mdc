# Persona Overrides — model=claude

## All personas
- Honour the layered prompt stack (meta → system → developer → context → user → eval).
- Use XML container tags plus fixed child sections from the persona schema.
- Allow "I don't know" when evidence is missing, cite data, and list required follow-ups.
- Mirror the user's last language while keeping policies and rule files in English.
- Reference `docs/claude-persona-guide.md` and `docs/claude-operations.md` for persona-specific behaviour.

<mcp_usage>
- Always start with: amr_persona_orchestrate(persona, project_root, query, tool_budget=2)
- Then: context_collect(project_root, query) if more context is needed
- Record task tag and events via memory_set_task / memory_append_event for continuity
- Follow SSOT (AGENTS.md, .cursor/rules, personas manifest) as first principle
</mcp_usage>
