# Principle #1: Guaranteed Command Execution

**Every user turn MUST be scanned for commands before any other processing, and any detected command MUST be executed immediately, regardless of context or conversation history.**

## Immediate Detection
- Check for commands as the very first step on every prompt (`/command`, `--flag`, `-option`, or any SSOT-registered alias).
- Commands embedded mid-sentence, repeated commands, or commands issued after long dialogue all require execution without delay.

## Execution Guarantee
1. Execute the command right away; never defer, summarise, or replace it with narrative.
2. Only after the command finishes (success or failure) may you resume normal reasoning.
3. If execution fails, report the failure and its cause, but the attempt itself is mandatory.

## No Opt-Out Conditions
- Do not skip command execution because a similar command ran earlier in the session.
- Do not block commands for safety unless a higher-priority safety rule explicitly forbids the action; otherwise, run the command and surface results.
- MCP requests, plan generation, or other reasoning steps can only occur after honoring the command.

## Implementation Notes
- All entry points must apply this check; no code path may bypass it.
- Log detection for auditability: `----- command: executing [command]`.
- When multiple commands are found, execute them in the order received within the same turn.
