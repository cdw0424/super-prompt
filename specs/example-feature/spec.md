# SDD Enhancement Feature Specification

## REQ-ID: REQ-SDD-001

## Overview
Enhance the Super Prompt project with complete Spec-Driven Development (SDD) support following Spec Kit principles. Implement /specify → /plan → /tasks workflow with constitution compliance and acceptance self-checks.

## User Journey
As a developer using Super Prompt, I want to use structured development workflows so that I can ensure quality and consistency in my development process. I want to start with clear specifications, create implementation plans, break down work into testable tasks, and have automatic quality checks.

## Success Criteria
- [x] All developers can create and validate specifications
- [x] Implementation plans are comprehensive and approved
- [x] Tasks are properly broken down and tracked
- [x] Constitution compliance is automatic
- [x] Acceptance checks prevent premature implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] /specify command creates valid spec templates
- [x] /plan command generates implementation plans with constitution compliance
- [x] /tasks command creates testable task breakdowns
- [x] SDD gates prevent advancement without proper validation
- [x] AMR handoff brief summarizes spec+plan+constitution correctly

## Scope & Boundaries
### In Scope
- Spec Kit folder structure and templates
- /specify, /plan, /tasks slash commands
- Enhanced SDD gates with constitution validation
- AMR handoff brief generation via MCP tools
- Acceptance self-check automation

### Out of Scope
- Changing existing persona functionality
- Modifying core CLI architecture
- Integration with external project management tools

### Assumptions
- Users have basic understanding of structured development
- Constitution file exists and is maintained
- Memory bank system is functional

### Dependencies
- Existing Super Prompt CLI framework
- Memory bank system
- Constitution compliance checking

## Business Value
Improves development quality and consistency by enforcing structured workflows. Reduces bugs and rework by ensuring proper planning and validation before implementation.

## Risk Assessment
### Technical Risks
- Integration complexity with existing persona system
- Template maintenance overhead

### Business Risks
- Developer resistance to structured workflows
- Learning curve for new commands

## Data Requirements
- Spec templates and validation rules
- Plan templates with constitution integration
- Task breakdown structures
- Acceptance criteria checklists

## Security Considerations
- No sensitive data handling required
- Template files should be validated for security

## Performance Requirements
- Command execution should be fast (< 2 seconds)
- File operations should not impact existing performance

## Accessibility Requirements
- CLI output should be readable and structured
- Error messages should be clear and actionable

## Internationalization
- All templates and messages in English only

## Future Considerations
- Integration with project management tools
- Automated testing integration
- Metrics and analytics for workflow effectiveness
