## üí° Usage Tips

### üéØ **Command Combination Strategy**
1. **Start with analysis:** `/analyzer` or `/seq` to understand the problem
2. **Get specialized help:** Choose domain expert (`/frontend`, `/backend`, etc.)
3. **Quality check:** Use `/review` or `/qa` to validate solutions
4. **Document:** Use `/scribe` for documentation

### ‚ö° **Efficiency Modes**
- Use `/ultracompressed` when you need quick, concise answers
- Use `/seq` or `/seq-ultra` for complex problem-solving
- Switch modes (`/grok-mode-on`) based on your current AI model

### üîÑ **Iterative Development**
- Start with `/spec` for requirements
- Use `/plan` for implementation strategy
- Apply `/implement` for execution
- Validate with `/review` and `/qa`

### üö® **Emergency Debugging**
```
/analyzer "Debug production issue: users can't login"
/security "Check for security vulnerabilities in auth flow"
