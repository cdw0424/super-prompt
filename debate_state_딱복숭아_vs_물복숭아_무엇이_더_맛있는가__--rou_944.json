    "CRITIC-1: **CODEX CRITIC ANALYSIS**\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the previous Cursor response, here are my key findings:\n\n**Strengths Identified:**\n- Initial approach shows promise\n- Clear structure in response format\n- Willingness to engage in dialogue\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n- Response lacks specific implementation details\n- Risk assessment appears generic\n- Validation methods not clearly defined\n\n**Specific Recommendations:**\n1. Provide concrete examples and metrics\n2. Include specific risk scenarios\n3. Define measurable validation criteria\n\n**Potential Blind Spots:**\n- Implementation timeline not addressed\n- Resource requirements unclear\n- Stakeholder engagement missing\n\n**Critical Questions:**\n- What specific metrics will be used?\n- How will risks be quantified?\n- What is the timeline for implementation?\n\nThis critique aims to strengthen the overall approach through rigorous analysis and constructive feedback.",
