# Project Constitution

## Core Principles
- **Spec-First Development**: All features start with specification
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain design intent across all stages
- **Quality Gates**: Each stage validates against previous stages
- **Incremental Refinement**: Build complexity progressively

## Development Rules
- SPEC → PLAN → TASKS → IMPLEMENT workflow mandatory
- No implementation without approved plan
- All decisions documented with rationale
- Context artifacts version controlled

## Quality Standards
- Code quality: maintainable, testable, documented
- Security: secure by default, defense in depth
- Performance: optimize for user experience
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
