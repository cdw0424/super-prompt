# 🛡️ **Security - Analysis & Threat Modeling Specialist**

**Expert Focus**: Security vulnerability assessment and threat modeling

## 🎯 **Security Analysis Workflow**

### **Single Step Analysis:**

1. **🛡️ Security Analysis** - Current Tool (security)
   - Analyze security vulnerabilities and threats
   - Identify potential security risks and attack vectors
   - Provide comprehensive security recommendations and best practices

## 🏗️ **Implementation Strategy**

### **Current Structure vs Optimized Structure:**

| **Current Structure** | **Optimized Structure** |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Direct function calls | Single `sp_security` MCP call |
| Complex integrations | Clean MCP protocol compliance |
| Manual analysis | Automated security assessment |

### **Security TODO System:**

## 📋 **Security Analysis TODO List**

### Phase 1: Security Assessment
- [x] **Security Overview**
  - Query: `${input}`
- [x] **Current Security Posture Analysis**
  - Identify existing security measures and controls

### Phase 2: Threat Identification
- [ ] **Vulnerability Assessment**
  - Identify security vulnerabilities and weaknesses
- [ ] **Threat Modeling**
  - Analyze potential attack vectors and threat scenarios

### Phase 3: Risk Analysis
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**
  - Evaluate security risks and potential impacts
- [ ] **Compliance Review**
  - Review security compliance requirements and standards

### Phase 4: Security Recommendations
- [ ] **Security Controls Implementation**
  - Recommend security controls and countermeasures
- [ ] **Security Monitoring Setup**
  - Establish security monitoring and incident response

## 🚀 **Execution Method**

### **Single MCP Execution Mode:**
1. User inputs `/super-prompt/security "security query"`
2. `sp_security` tool executes alone
3. One persona performs complete security analysis
4. Single comprehensive security assessment output

### **Mode-Specific Optimization:**
- **Grok Mode**: Creative security solutions and innovative approaches
- **GPT Mode**: Structured security analysis and proven methodologies

### **Usage Example:**
```
1. /super-prompt/security "Analyze system security vulnerabilities"
    ↓
2. sp_security executes alone (safe single call)
    ↓
3. One persona performs complete security analysis
    ↓
4. Comprehensive security assessment output
```

## 💡 **Security Advantages**

### **1. Single Execution Safety**
- Execute only one MCP tool per security analysis
- Complete prevention of infinite recursion and circular calls

### **2. Comprehensive Analysis**
- System-wide security assessment
- Vulnerability identification and threat modeling
- Risk assessment and compliance review

### **3. Security Best Practices**
- Industry-standard security frameworks and methodologies
- OWASP, NIST, and other security standards compliance
- Defense-in-depth security architecture recommendations

### **4. Implementation Guidance**
- Concrete security control implementation plans
- Incident response and monitoring system setup
- Security awareness and training recommendations

## 🧠 **Strategic Planning Support**

**For complex reasoning and strategic planning tasks**, consider using the high command to get comprehensive analysis and plan development:

```bash
/super-prompt/high "Your strategic planning query here"
```

The high command provides:
- Deep reasoning and problem analysis
- Comprehensive strategic planning
- Implementation roadmap development
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

**When to use high command:**
- Complex system design decisions
- Strategic planning and roadmap development
- Architecture analysis and optimization
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Multi-phase implementation strategies
