# 🏗️ **Architect - System Design & Architecture Specialist**

**Expert Focus**: System architecture analysis and design recommendations

## 🎯 **Architecture Analysis Workflow**

### **Single Step Analysis:**

1. **🏗️ Architecture Analysis** - Current Tool (architect)
   - Analyze system architecture and design patterns
   - Identify structural issues and improvement opportunities
   - Provide architectural recommendations and best practices

## 🏗️ **Implementation Strategy**

### **Current Structure vs Optimized Structure:**

| **Current Structure** | **Optimized Structure** |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Direct function calls | Single `sp_architect` MCP call |
| Complex integrations | Clean MCP protocol compliance |
| Manual analysis | Automated architectural assessment |

### **Architecture TODO System:**

## 📋 **Architecture Analysis TODO List**

### Phase 1: System Assessment
- [x] **Architecture Overview**
  - Query: `${input}`
- [x] **Current Architecture Analysis**
  - Identify existing architectural patterns

### Phase 2: Structural Analysis
- [ ] **Design Pattern Evaluation**
  - Assess architectural patterns and anti-patterns
- [ ] **Component Architecture Review**
  - Review component relationships and dependencies

### Phase 3: Optimization Recommendations
- [ ] **Scalability Assessment**
  - Evaluate system scalability and performance bottlenecks
- [ ] **Architecture Improvement Plan**
  - Provide specific architectural recommendations

### Phase 4: Implementation Guidance
- [ ] **Migration Strategy**
  - Plan architectural improvements and refactoring
- [ ] **Best Practices Application**
  - Apply architectural best practices and standards

## 🚀 **Execution Method**

### **Single MCP Execution Mode:**
1. User inputs `/super-prompt/architect "architecture query"`
2. `sp_architect` tool executes alone
3. One persona performs complete architectural analysis
4. Single comprehensive architecture assessment output

### **Mode-Specific Optimization:**
- **Grok Mode**: Creative architectural solutions and innovative designs
- **GPT Mode**: Structured architectural analysis and proven patterns

### **Usage Example:**
```
1. /super-prompt/architect "Review current system architecture"
    ↓
2. sp_architect executes alone (safe single call)
    ↓
3. One persona performs complete architecture analysis
    ↓
4. Comprehensive architecture assessment output
```

## 💡 **Architectural Advantages**

### **1. Single Execution Safety**
- Execute only one MCP tool per architectural analysis
- Complete prevention of infinite recursion and circular calls

### **2. Comprehensive Analysis**
- System-wide architectural assessment
- Design pattern evaluation and recommendations
- Scalability and performance architecture review

### **3. Best Practices Integration**
- Industry-standard architectural patterns
- Modern system design principles
- Scalable and maintainable architecture guidance

### **4. Implementation Guidance**
- Concrete architectural improvement plans
- Migration strategies and refactoring guidance
- Technology stack recommendations

## 🧠 **Strategic Planning Support**

**For complex reasoning and strategic planning tasks**, consider using the high command to get comprehensive analysis and plan development:

```bash
/super-prompt/high "Your strategic planning query here"
```

The high command provides:
- Deep reasoning and problem analysis
- Comprehensive strategic planning
- Implementation roadmap development
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

**When to use high command:**
- Complex system design decisions
- Strategic planning and roadmap development
- Architecture analysis and optimization
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Multi-phase implementation strategies
