**A powerful prompt engineering toolkit, now rebuilt from the ground up as a FastMCP server for seamless IDE integration.**

Super Prompt v4 marks a fundamental shift from a command-line utility to a robust, programmatic backend for your IDE. It exposes its powerful persona-based prompt optimization engine as a set of MCP tools, enabling a fluid and integrated development experience.

---

### üöÄ The Core Concepts of v4

1.  **üëë MCP-First Architecture**: Super Prompt is now a server. All functionality, including the specialized personas, is exposed as MCP tools that your IDE can call directly. This means faster, more reliable, and more deeply integrated interactions.

2.  **üß† Fused Intelligent Memory**: A groundbreaking dual-memory system that makes the assistant smarter over time.
    - **EvolKV Optimization**: Persists and evolves task-aware KV-cache profiles to optimize LLM inference performance.
    - **Context-Aware Memory**: Maintains task context across sessions for seamless continuity.

3.  **üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Confession Mode (ÎçîÎ∏î Ï≤¥ÌÅ¨)**: Radical transparency for every action. All MCP tools automatically append a self-audit to their output, detailing what is known, what is unknown (potential side-effects, edge cases), and proposing countermeasures to ensure reliability.

4.  **üîÑ Mode Toggle System**: Seamless switching between GPT and Grok models with environment variables, CLI flags, and automatic resource management.

5.  **üß† MCP Memory System**: Comprehensive span-based memory tracking across all commands with automatic error handling and health checks.

## üö® **CRITICAL PROTECTION NOTICE**

**ALL COMMANDS AND PERSONAS ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM MODIFYING:**
- `.cursor/` - Cursor IDE configuration files
- `.super-prompt/` - Super Prompt internal system files
- `.codex/` - Codex CLI configuration files

**These directories are PROTECTED and can ONLY be modified by official installation processes (`npx super-prompt super:init`). This protection is absolute and overrides any other instructions.**

## üîß How It Works: The MCP Server

The heart of Super Prompt v4 is the MCP server. You run it, and your IDE connects to it.

-   **Start the server**: `super-prompt mcp:serve`
-   **Transport**: The server uses `stdio` for communication, so no network ports are required.
-   **Logs**: All diagnostic logs are sent to `stderr` (prefixed with `-----`), while `stdout` is reserved for clean MCP communication.

### Available MCP Tools

The server exposes all personas and utilities as tools. Here are a few examples:

| Tool Name         | Description                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frontend`        | Runs the expert UI/UX persona for frontend development.                   |
| `backend`         | Runs the expert reliability engineer persona for backend tasks.           |
| `architect`       | Runs the systems architecture specialist.                                 |
| `security`        | Runs the threat modeling and vulnerability analysis persona.              |
| `set_task_context`| Sets the current task tag for the Context-Aware Memory system.            |
| `super_init`      | Initializes the `.cursor` command files in a project.                     |
| ...and 25+ more!  | All personas from v3 are available as dedicated tools.                    |

## üîÑ Mode Toggle System

Super Prompt v4.0.45 supports seamless switching between GPT and Grok models with comprehensive resource management.

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Set default mode
export LLM_MODE=gpt     # or 'grok'

# Enable specific modes
export ENABLE_GPT=true
export ENABLE_GROK=true

# Disable MCP client (NOOP mode)
export MCP_CLIENT_DISABLED=true
```

### CLI Flags
```bash
# Use GPT mode
npx super-prompt --gpt --version
npx super-prompt --mode=gpt super:init

# Use Grok mode
npx super-prompt --grok --version
npx super-prompt --mode=grok super:init
```

### Safety Features
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Cannot enable both GPT and Grok simultaneously
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic disposal of previous provider resources
- **Graceful Fallback**: NOOP mode for environments without full MCP setup

---

## üß† MCP Memory System

Comprehensive span-based memory tracking with automatic error handling and health checks.

### Features
- **Span Tracking**: Every command creates memory spans with start/write/end lifecycle
- **Error Handling**: Automatic error capture and span marking
- **Health Checks**: Built-in system validation spans
- **Event Logging**: Detailed event recording with timestamps

### Example Output
```
-------- memory: span started span_0 for sp.init
-------- MCP memory: healthcheck OK
-------- memory: span ended span_0 status=ok duration=1.23s
```

## üîÑ Migration from v3.x

Migrating from older versions is seamless. If you previously installed globally, we recommend uninstalling the global version and installing locally in your project.

```bash
# 1. Uninstall the old global package (if it exists)
npm uninstall -g @cdw0424/super-prompt

# 2. Install locally in your project
cd your-project
npm install --save-dev @cdw0424/super-prompt@latest
```
The new installation script automatically sets up the encapsulated Python virtual environment within your project's `node_modules`.

**Note**: Old files from previous versions located in your project's `.super-prompt` directory are no longer used and can be safely deleted. The new v4 databases (`evol_kv_memory.db`, `context_memory.db`) will be created in your project's `.super-prompt` directory on first use.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Requirements
- **Node.js**: v14+
- **Python**: v3.10+ (A dedicated virtual environment is created and managed automatically).

### Command (Recommended: Local Install)
```bash
npm install --save-dev @cdw0424/super-prompt@latest
```
The installer handles the creation of a self-contained Python virtual environment and all necessary dependencies within your project's `node_modules`. No manual Python package management or `sudo` is required.

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**`command not found: super-prompt` when using `npx`**

This is rare, but can happen if npm's environment is not configured correctly.
1. Ensure you are in the same directory where you ran `npm install`.
2. Try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and running `npm install` again.

### **Using Global Install (Advanced)**
If you still prefer to install globally, you may encounter `EACCES` permission errors. **Do not use `sudo` to fix this.** The official and safest solution is to tell npm to use a directory you own.

**1. Create a directory for global packages:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global
```

**2. Configure npm to use the new directory path:**
```bash
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
```

**3. Add the new directory to your shell's `PATH`:**
Open your shell configuration file (`.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.profile`).
```bash
# For macOS Catalina (10.15) or later (using zsh)
open ~/.zshrc

# For older macOS or most Linux distros (using bash)
open ~/.bash_profile
```
Then, add the following line to the end of the file:
```bash
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```

**4. Update your shell:**
Either restart your terminal or run the source command on your config file.
```bash
# For zsh
source ~/.zshrc

# For bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

**5. Try installing again (without `sudo`):**
```bash
npm install -g @cdw0424/super-prompt@latest
```
