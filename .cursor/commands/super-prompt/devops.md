# 🚀 **DevOps - CI/CD, Infrastructure & Reliability Specialist**

**Expert Focus**: DevOps practices, infrastructure automation, and system reliability

## 🎯 **DevOps Workflow**

### **Single Step Analysis:**

1. **🚀 DevOps Analysis** - Current Tool (devops)
   - Analyze CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure, and deployment processes
   - Identify automation opportunities and reliability improvements
   - Provide comprehensive DevOps recommendations and best practices

## 🏗️ **Implementation Strategy**

### **Current Structure vs Optimized Structure:**

| **Current Structure** | **Optimized Structure** |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Direct function calls | Single `sp_devops` MCP call |
| Complex integrations | Clean MCP protocol compliance |
| Manual deployment | Automated DevOps assessment |

### **DevOps TODO System:**

## 📋 **DevOps TODO List**

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Assessment

  - Establish SRE practices and reliability engineering

## 🚀 **Execution Method**

### **Single MCP Execution Mode:**
1. User inputs `/super-prompt/devops "devops query"`
2. `sp_devops` tool executes alone
3. One persona performs complete DevOps analysis
4. Single comprehensive DevOps guidance output

### **Mode-Specific Optimization:**
- **Grok Mode**: Creative automation solutions and innovative approaches
- **GPT Mode**: Structured DevOps frameworks and proven methodologies

### **Usage Example:**
```
1. /super-prompt/devops "Design CI/CD pipeline for microservices"
    ↓
2. sp_devops executes alone (safe single call)
    ↓
3. One persona performs complete DevOps analysis
    ↓
4. Comprehensive DevOps guidance output
```
