# ‚ö° **Performance - Optimization & Bottleneck Analysis Specialist**

**Expert Focus**: Performance optimization and system bottleneck identification

## üéØ **Performance Analysis Workflow**

### **Single Step Analysis:**

1. **‚ö° Performance Analysis** - Current Tool (performance)
   - Analyze system performance metrics and bottlenecks
   - Identify performance optimization opportunities
   - Provide actionable performance improvement recommendations

## üèóÔ∏è **Implementation Strategy**

### **Current Structure vs Optimized Structure:**

| **Current Structure** | **Optimized Structure** |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Direct function calls | Single `sp_performance` MCP call |
| Complex integrations | Clean MCP protocol compliance |
| Manual analysis | Automated performance assessment |

### **Performance TODO System:**

## üìã **Performance Analysis TODO List**

### Phase 1: Performance Assessment

## üöÄ **Execution Method**

### **Single MCP Execution Mode:**
1. User inputs `/super-prompt/performance "performance query"`
2. `sp_performance` tool executes alone
3. One persona performs complete performance analysis
4. Single comprehensive performance assessment output

### **Mode-Specific Optimization:**
- **Grok Mode**: Creative optimization solutions and innovative approaches
- **GPT Mode**: Structured performance analysis and proven techniques

### **Usage Example:**
```
1. /super-prompt/performance "Analyze system performance bottlenecks"
    ‚Üì
2. sp_performance executes alone (safe single call)
    ‚Üì
3. One persona performs complete performance analysis
    ‚Üì
4. Comprehensive performance assessment output
```

## üí° **Performance Advantages**
