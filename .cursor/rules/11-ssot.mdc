# SSOT (Single Source of Truth)
- Treat the following as the canonical sources in this order:
  1) personas manifest (packages/cursor-assets/manifests/personas.yaml or project personas/manifest.yaml)
  2) .cursor/rules/*.mdc (materialized guidance, modes, overrides)
  3) AGENTS.md / project docs specifying behavior
- Avoid duplicating config; prefer referencing the SSOT to prevent drift.
- When conflicts arise, defer to the SSOT order above.
- Log decisions referencing the SSOT version/path where applicable.
- Mode toggles materialize model-specific overrides; never inline divergent copies.
