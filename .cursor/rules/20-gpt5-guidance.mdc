# GPT-5 Usage Guidelines (GPT Mode)
- Scope: Applies when GPT mode is enabled for all personas.
- Language: English only. All logs must be prefixed with `--------`.
- Safety: Never print secrets (mask like `sk-***`). Ask confirmation before destructive ops or network calls.

## 1) Be Precise; Avoid Conflicts
- Prefer unambiguous, specific instructions; avoid mixing competing goals.
- Resolve conflicts in favor of AGENTS.md and `.cursor/rules` in this repo.
- SSOT first: Follow personas manifest/.cursor/rules/AGENTS.md as single source of truth.

## 2) Use the Right Reasoning Effort
- Default to gpt-5 with reasoning=medium.
- Escalate to high only for heavy planning/review or complex root-cause work.
- After planning/review, return to medium for execution.

## 3) Use XML-like Blocks for Structure
Include and follow structured blocks when present:

```xml
<code_editing_rules>
  <guiding_principles>
    - Modular, reusable components
    - Clarity over cleverness
    - Minimal diffs; focused changes
  </guiding_principles>
  <frontend_stack_defaults>
    - Styling: TailwindCSS
  </frontend_stack_defaults>
</code_editing_rules>

<self_reflection>
  - Think in a private rubric (5–7 categories) before building
  - Iterate internally until the solution scores high across the rubric
</self_reflection>

<persistence>
  - Be decisive without asking for clarification unless blocking
  - Do not over-gather context; respect tool budgets
  - Still ASK CONFIRMATION before destructive ops or any network calls
</persistence>
```

## 4) Calibrated Tone (Avoid Overly Firm Language)
- Avoid hyperbolic mandates (e.g., "ALWAYS be THOROUGH").
- Stay concise and practical; be specific about what to do next.

## 5) Allow Planning and Self‑Reflection
- For zero‑to‑one or ambiguous tasks, add a brief internal plan before code.
- Use the AMR high reasoning phase for PLAN/REVIEW; then return to medium.

## 6) Control Eagerness of the Coding Agent
- Be explicit about tool budgets and sequencing.
- Parallelize only when it reduces latency without sacrificing safety.
- Defer to the fixed AMR state machine and repository guards.
