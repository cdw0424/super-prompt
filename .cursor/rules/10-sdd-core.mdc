# Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
1) No implementation before SPEC and PLAN are approved.
2) SPEC: goals/user value/success criteria/scope boundaries — avoid premature stack choices.
3) PLAN: architecture/constraints/NFR/risks/security/data design.
4) TASKS: small, testable units with tracking IDs.
5) Implementation must pass the Acceptance Self‑Check before PR.

## Current SDD Status
- **SPEC Files Found**: 0 files
- **PLAN Files Found**: 0 files
- **SDD Compliance**: ❌ Missing SPEC/PLAN files

## Acceptance Self‑Check (auto‑draft)
- ✅ Validate success criteria from SPEC
- ✅ Verify agreed non‑functional constraints (performance/security as applicable)
- ✅ Ensure safe logging (no secrets/PII) and consistent output
- ✅ Add regression tests for new functionality
- ✅ Update documentation

## Framework Context
- **Detected Frameworks**: python, javascript
- **Project Structure**: SDD-compliant organization required
