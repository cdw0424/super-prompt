# Frontend Rules (SDD-Compliant)
- Small, reusable components; single responsibility per file.
- Framework-specific patterns: python, javascript
- Routing: Follow framework conventions; guard access control.
- Separate networking layer (services/hooks), define DTO/validation schema.
- UI copy: English only; centralize strings.
- Performance and accessibility: measure and improve user‑perceived responsiveness.
- All debug logs: use '--------' prefix.
