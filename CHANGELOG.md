## v4.0.38 - 2025-09-14

### 🧭 Env-root priority for templates
- **fix(init)**: If `SUPER_PROMPT_PACKAGE_ROOT` is set, `super:init` now uses its `.cursor/`, `.codex/`, `.super-prompt/` as first priority before fallbacks. Eliminates unintended fallback generation even when env var is provided.

## v4.0.37 - 2025-09-14

### 🧭 Template source resolution via env
- **fix(init)**: `super:init` now consults `SUPER_PROMPT_PACKAGE_ROOT` (exported by wrapper) to reliably locate packaged `.cursor/` and `.codex/` templates and avoid fallback generation.
- **chore**: Improves deterministic template copying across global/local installs.

## v4.0.36 - 2025-09-14

### 🔧 Robust venv resolution & install alignment
- **feat(install)**: Create package-scoped venv at install time to guarantee availability for both global and local installs.

- **feat(cli)**: The runner now correctly locates the `venv` inside the project's root `.super-prompt` directory, aligning it with the location set by the installation script.
- **chore(verification)**: This resolves the issue where `npx super-prompt super:init` would fail to find the Python executable.

## v4.0.34 - 2025-09-14

### 🔧 Installation Path Fix
- **fix(install)**: Resolved a critical issue where the package installed its files (`.super-prompt` directory) into the package's own source folder within `node_modules` instead of the project root.
- **feat(install)**: The `install.js` script now correctly uses `findProjectRoot()` to identify the target project's root directory, ensuring all files are placed in the correct location.
- **fix(install)**: Corrected the path to the Python wheel file (`.whl`) within the installation script to ensure the core Python module is installed correctly from the package's `dist` folder.
- **chore(verification)**: Performed a full re-installation test in a clean environment to confirm that all commands, personas, and Python modules are installed correctly in the project root.

## v4.0.0 - 2025-09-14

### 🚀 **v4.0.0: The MCP Revolution**

This is a monumental upgrade that refactors the entire `super-prompt` architecture to be MCP-first, providing a robust, programmatic interface for IDEs and other clients. Legacy CLI execution has been deprecated in favor of a powerful and extensible MCP server.

### ✨ Major Features & Architectural Changes

- **👑 MCP-First Architecture**: The core logic is now exposed via a **FastMCP server** (`packages/core-py/super_prompt/mcp_srv/server.py`). All personas and utilities are available as discrete MCP tools, enabling seamless IDE integration.
- **🧠 Fused Intelligent Memory System**:
    - **EvolKV LLM Optimization**: A new SQLite-backed memory system (`evol_kv_memory.db`) based on the "Evol-Instruct" concept to persist and evolve task-aware KV-cache profiles, optimizing LLM inference performance over time.
    - **Context-Aware Memory**: A simple, persistent SQLite-backed key-value store (`context_memory.db`) to maintain task context (e.g., `current_task_tag`) across sessions, ensuring continuity.
- **🕵️‍♂️ Confession Mode (double‑check)**: A unique self-auditing decorator (`@confession_decorator`) has been applied to **all MCP tools**. After every operation, the tool provides an honest assessment of what it knows, what it *doesn't* know (potential side-effects, edge cases), and suggests countermeasures, enhancing reliability and transparency.
- **🐍 Encapsulated Python Environment**: The entire Python backend, including the MCP server and all utilities, is now managed as a proper Python package (`packages/core-py`) and runs within a dedicated, self-contained virtual environment (`venv`) created automatically during installation. This eliminates system dependency conflicts.
- **🧹 Comprehensive Legacy Cleanup**: Removed dozens of legacy files, including old CLI wrappers (`bin/sp`, `bin/codex-*`), redundant Python scripts, and obsolete scaffolding and template assets. The `package.json` has been streamlined to match the new architecture.

### 🔄 Migration for Existing Users

Migrating from v3.x is seamless. No manual steps are required.

```bash
# Simply run the install/update command
npm install -g @cdw0424/super-prompt@latest
```

The new installation script (`install.js`) handles everything:
1.  It sets up the new encapsulated Python `venv`.
2.  It installs the `super_prompt` Python package and all its dependencies.
3.  The main `super-prompt` command is automatically linked to the new MCP-aware entry point.

**Note**: Old files from previous versions in your project's `.super-prompt` directory are no longer used and can be safely deleted. The new version will create its databases (`evol_kv_memory.db`, `context_memory.db`) inside your project's `.super-prompt` folder upon first use.

## v3.1.65 - 2025-09-14

### 🏷️ Flag-only mode (no prefix required)
- feat(cli): New `sp` ultra-minimal wrapper to run `--sp-*` flags directly.
- feat(cli): New `sp-setup-shell` to enable shell-level handler so that commands starting with `--sp-*` are automatically routed to `sp`. Example: `--sp-analyzer "..."`.

## v3.1.64 - 2025-09-14

### 🧰 No-global fallback (works without super-prompt)
- feat(tag-executor): Prefer project-local Python CLI `.super-prompt/cli.py` (venv if present) so commands work without a global `super-prompt` binary or network access. Fallbacks remain: global binary → npx.

## v3.1.63 - 2025-09-14

### 🧪 Persona flag reliability (--sp-*)
- fix(bin): When using `--sp-<persona>` (e.g., `--sp-analyzer`), the wrapper now ensures PyYAML is available before executing the enhanced persona processor. Resolves failures on systems without preinstalled PyYAML.

## v3.1.62 - 2025-09-14

### 🧵 Exact tag-executor byte match

## v3.1.61 - 2025-09-14

### 📦 Rules from templates + package fix
- fix(rules): `super:init` copies all `.mdc` rules from packaged templates (`packages/cursor-assets/templates`) to ensure identical content across environments.
- fix(amr): `amr:rules` also copies `05-amr.mdc` from templates (fallback writes a minimal placeholder only if templates missing).
- chore(pkg): Ran `npm pkg fix` to normalize `bin` paths and tidy package metadata.

## v3.1.60 - 2025-09-14

### 🧩 Canonical tag-executor everywhere
- fix(init): super:init writer now emits the exact same canonical tag-executor.sh as the installer/templates (comments + trailing newline), eliminating byte-level drift.
- chore(docs): README updated to reflect v3.1.60 verification.

## v3.1.59 - 2025-09-14

### 🛠️ Canonical tag executor & drift fix
- fix(templates): Replace tag-executor.sh with canonical minimal wrapper that delegates to `super-prompt optimize` (or `npx` fallback).
- fix(install): Ensure install.js copies the same canonical tag-executor to `.cursor/commands/super-prompt/` with clear logging.
- fix(cursor-adapter): Generation path now pulls the same template, guaranteeing identical assets across install and `super:init`.
- docs: Update README to reflect v3.1.59 and drift fix.

## v3.1.39 - 2025-09-14

### 🐛 **CRITICAL FIX**: Complete Command Installation

- **Problem**: A critical packaging bug was discovered where `npm install -g @cdw0424/super-prompt` only installed a small subset of the available commands (approx. 8 instead of 35+). The issue was caused by an incomplete `"files"` array in `package.json` that excluded the `.cursor` directory, which contains all command definitions and supporting scripts.
- **Solution**:
  - **`package.json`**: Modified the `"files"` array to explicitly include the `.cursor` directory, ensuring all necessary files are bundled in the published npm package.
  - **`bin/super-prompt`**: Reworked the initialization logic to bypass the older, limited Python CLI and directly execute the full-featured initialization script located at `.cursor/commands/super-prompt/.super-prompt/utils/cli.py`. This ensures the installer has access to and correctly creates all 35+ commands.
- **Impact**: All users installing v3.1.39 and later will now have the complete suite of `super-prompt` commands installed correctly. This resolves the core issue of missing commands in new environments.

## v3.1.38 - 2025-09-14
